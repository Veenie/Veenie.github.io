I had a lot of fun working with Rails for the first time. I constructed a movie review app that allows you to write reviews for films in the Batman franchise. I actually really liked working with rails, once you are used to the conventions it becomes very simple to organize and route your app just the way you want it. It really allows you to get creative. For example, I have and index of movies and each movie has reviews. I was able to arrange it so every reviews show page is routed through the movie it belongs to so at a glance in the url bar you are still aware of which movie you came from. So to go back to the show page, someone could just delete /reviews. It makes it so there is a logic to the flow the user experiences when navigating through the site!

Even though my project is feature complete, I love playing around with gems to style my app, it's pretty addicting. I can't wait to dig into even more gems!
