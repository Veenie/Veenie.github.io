Coding in Ruby has been a very eye opening experience. At first, I did not really understand the test failures, but now I am very comfortable with them. I've had experience learning a second language and it's very similar. What seems daunting and impossible to understand at first becomes second nature. It's a great feeling of accomplishment when I get all my tests passing. I'm really looking forward to some of the more advanced stuff, scraping looks like fun!
