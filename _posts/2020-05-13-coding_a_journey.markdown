I have long had an interest in coding, going back to when I first watched The Matrix. It felt like you could use code to do anything; the possibilities were endless. Having gone through the First Mile portion of the program, it seems like I was not far off from the truth. Sometimes labs can be a real challenge, but the feeling of accomplishment you get overcoming them is such an amazing rush. Just days ago, I was a complete beginner and in a very short time I feel like I know so much more now than when I started. Error messages that seemed like gibberish before now make sense to me! I am very excited to learn more and I am very much looking forward to where my knowledge of coding will take me!
